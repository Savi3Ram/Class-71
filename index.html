<h4 class="text-capitlize"><kbd>Niagara Falls</kbd></h4>

<hr>

<h5 class="text-success text-capitlize">I visited this in 25-May-2024</h5>

<p class="text-muted">These falls, with the honorous title of Niagara Falls, look beautiful in every perspective, evn if it is split in half by two countries. One half is in the U.S., and the other in Canada (me personally, the Canada view is better). When you go to the falls, there are a bunch of area you can visit such as the following: ziplines, mini golf, ferris wheels, and so on. These waterfalls are my #1 area to go to. I suggest to try all the food like popcorn and ice cream on both sides. Even though it would be a very expensive trip to plan and go to, you still get a very exquisite and gorgeous view of the main attraction, Niagara Falls.</p>

<h4 class="text-capitlize"><kbd>Roman Colosseum/Amphitheater</kbd></h4>

<hr>

<h5 class="text-success text-capitlize">I would like to visit by 2035</h5>

<p class="text-muted">This amphitheater, known as The Roman Colosseum, looks to be one of the most majestic and anchient areas ever. I would love to go the this place in Rome, Italy. It would be able to fit a lot of people and maybe my family and I can go on a tour inside it. This took about 7-8 years to build for the people and I think they derserve rewards for this hard work. Although I haven't gone, I recommend going to this area just by its looks. Maybe it is overpriced, but it is still one of the oldest and most certainly mysterious places to visit.</p>

<p>I watched this movie with my parents and it was amazing! It is funny but serious at the same time. Even if you have not watched the first movie, it is still a very good movie to watch. Sonic the Hedgehog, the main character, just sent the evil villan Robotnik to the Mushroom World though his special ring which he uses to automatically teleport to any world he wishes to go to. He landed on Earth and now has to live there because he has nowhere to go. Somehow, Robotnik finds out how to get back to Earth with the help of a companion, who also is an enemy of Sonic. His name is Knuckles. Sonic gets saved by Tails and they go on a mission to find the master emerald, which they need to stop Robotnik from getting untimate power. If you watch the movie yourself, you will be surprised by how good the animations and voicing are. Overall, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen</p>

<p>This movie, Turning Red, I watched in India with my friends. I usually don't watch movies like these, but I did, and it was quite fun. It was a very good movie and the animations were nice. I like how the girl can turn into a red fox, because that makes it a whole different movie. All in all, this is a very thought provoking movie that I really enjoyed.</p>
